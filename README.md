# System Setup and Customisation with Ansible üõ†Ô∏è

This Ansible playbook is designed for automating the configuration of local systems. It performs a series of tasks including adding the Flathub repository, installing Google Chrome and Tidal via Flatpak, setting the system's timezone, and many more. The playbook automatically detects if the system has an Nvidia GPU and, if so, installs the proprietary Nvidia drivers. Please ensure you have Ansible installed before proceeding.
